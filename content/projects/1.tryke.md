A custom-designed three-wheeled electric trike, engineered for urban and outdoor family mobility. The trike was designed, prototyped, and manufactured entirely in our studio, featuring a metal bent tube frame, custom jigs, and full electrification.

**Initiated by:**
Studio Halalit â€“ A self-initiated project exploring family-friendly urban mobility solutions.

**Design & Manufacturing Process:**
The goal was to develop a versatile, robust, and ergonomic trike capable of transporting two children and groceries, making it ideal for both city commuting and outdoor adventures.
Key stages of development included:
- Frame Design & Fabrication â€“ Engineered a durable metal tube frame, optimized for strength, comfort, and modularity.
- Custom Manufacturing Jigs â€“ Designed and built precision jigs to streamline tube bending and frame welding.
- Full In-House Assembly â€“ Every aspect of the vehicle was manufactured, welded, and assembled in our studio.
- Electrification & Testing â€“ Developed and integrated an electric drive system, resulting in two fully functional working prototypes.

Outcome & Vision:
The trike is a practical and efficient family transport solution, bridging the gap between bicycles and cargo vehicles. It offers:
- âœ… Comfortable seating for two children
- âœ… Ample storage space for groceries and daily essentials
- âœ… Electric power for extended range and reduced effort

Future improvements may include lightweight material exploration, enhanced battery integration, and modular add-ons for various lifestyle needs.
This project represents our commitment to designing and building sustainable, human-centered mobility solutions. ðŸš²âš¡
