An interactive installation exploring how technology can transition from a mental burden to a tool for cognitive spaciousness. Through kinetic, light-emitting sculptures inspired by organic forms, the project investigates how physical and digital environments can help shift perception from identification with thoughts (“I am my thoughts”) to observing them (“I am the witness”).

**Motivation & Research Background:**

In recent years, global anxiety, stress, and digital overload have surged, increasing awareness of overthinking as a modern condition. Many researchers and mindfulness practitioners (Eckhart Tolle, John Elwood, Jon Kabat-Zinn) describe thought addiction as a root cause of suffering.

**This project builds on the idea that:**
- Many people over-identify with thoughts, believing their sense of self depends on continuous thinking.
- Digital technology reinforces constant cognitive stimulation, making mental silence difficult.
- Creating intentional gaps between thoughts can reduce stress, enhance awareness, and promote a deeper sense of self.

Through research into Buddhist psychology, meditation science, and digital mindfulness, the project aims to answer:
 Can interactive, technology-infused objects be designed to create mental space and guide people toward stillness?

**The Final Installation:** Interactive Light-Emitting Flowers
To materialize this concept, GAP THE MIND was realized as a series of kinetic, light-responsive sculptures inspired by organic growth patterns. The final prototypes resemble delicate, unfolding flowers, composed of:
- Origami-like folded structures that expand and contract in response to environmental cues.
- Fiber-optic lighting that simulates the effect of pulsing energy and bioluminescence, emphasizing rhythm and spaciousness.
- Microcontroller-based control systems that allow the sculptures to react dynamically to touch, sound, or movement.

Each sculpture is a meditative object, designed to engage both visual and tactile perception, subtly guiding the viewer toward a slower, more spacious mental state.

**Research Themes & Experimentation:**
The project investigated various material, sensory, and conceptual techniques to induce a sense of mental expansion, including:
- Sound & Silence – Using fiber-optic elements to create waves of light pulses, mimicking auditory mindfulness techniques that emphasize pauses between sounds.
- Form & Space – Exploring negative space within geometric structures, prompting viewers to focus on the emptiness as much as the form.
- Nature & Biomimicry – Deriving shapes and movements from natural systems (e.g., petals unfolding, breathing patterns) to resonate with innate human rhythms.
- Interactive Light & Motion – Utilizing subtle kinetic elements to create an ever-changing interplay of structure and absence, mirroring thought patterns.
- Tactile Engagement – Encouraging viewers to approach, touch, or observe the movement of the objects, fostering presence through interaction.

**Outcome & Reflection:**
The final exhibition of GAP THE MIND presented a series of interactive, illuminated floral sculptures, installed in a dimly lit space to heighten their ethereal, meditative presence. Observers reported a calming effect, with some describing a sense of entrainment to the slow, organic pulsations of light and form.
This project represents a fusion of mindfulness, biomimetic design, and interactive technology, raising further questions about the role of art and design in mental well-being.

**Future Directions:**
Potential expansions of the project include:
- Scaling the kinetic sculptures for public spaces as an urban mindfulness intervention.
- Developing digital applications that mimic the visual rhythm and spaciousness of the sculptures in a virtual environment.
- Integrating biofeedback sensors to personalize the movement and light patterns based on the viewer’s physiological state.

GAP THE MIND ultimately serves as an exploration of how technology, when designed with intent, can open rather than clutter the mind—transforming interaction into meditation.
