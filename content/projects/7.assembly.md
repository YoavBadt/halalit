A defence company approached us with a request to develop and manufacture an electro-mechanical testing device for a specific assembly line process. We developed a testing protocol, built a POC and integrated it into the production line process.

The device is actively working, and managed to detect several production issues successfully. We incorporated user feedback and improved the system until we reached a production level unit which we then replicated for 10 units.
