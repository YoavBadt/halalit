**Design process:**
At Studio Halalit, we set out to develop a compact, modular, and high-capacity energy system that leverages the widely available 48V e-bike battery standard. Our goal was to create a versatile power source for various applications, including camping, emergency backup, mobile workstations, and outdoor adventures.
We designed Ram-Or as a plug-and-play power hub, allowing users to swap out e-bike batteries easily and quickly, eliminating the need for proprietary battery packs. The system is lightweight and portable, yet powerful enough to support multiple devices simultaneously.
Key Features:
48VDC 20A Power Output – Suitable for high-power applications.
USB Charging (3 Ports) – Capable of charging 30+ mobile devices on a single battery.
Type-C 65W Fast Charging – Supports 10+ laptop charges, making it ideal for remote work.
12V 20A Output (Cigarette Lighter) – Provides 10+ hours of cooling for portable fridges.
Universal Battery Compatibility – Works with any 48V e-bike battery, ensuring flexibility.
Easy Battery Swapping – Allows for quick and tool-free replacement of depleted batteries.
Solar Charging Support – Enables off-grid renewable energy replenishment.
Integrated Battery Status Display – Ensures real-time monitoring of charge levels.
Perimeter Lighting – Built-in illumination for outdoor and emergency use.

**Outcome:**
Ram-Or is now in the prototyping and testing phase, with real-world trials underway. We aim to refine the system for mass production, making clean, portable energy more accessible and adaptable for diverse users.
