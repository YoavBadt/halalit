**Initiated by:**
Studio Halalit – A research-driven design and fabrication initiative.

**Design Process:**
Recognizing the need for aesthetic, personalized, and functional prosthetic covers, our studio developed a workflow that ensures a perfect fit and unique design for each individual.

**The process involved:**

- 3D Scanning – Capturing the exact shape of the prosthetic limb for a seamless and ergonomic fit.
- Parametric 3D Modeling – Developing organic, textured patterns inspired by nature and contemporary design aesthetics.
- 3D Printing – Fabricating the covers using lightweight yet durable materials, ensuring both structural integrity and comfort.

Each cover is tailored to enhance personal expression, offering amputees greater confidence and individuality in their prosthetic solutions.

**Outcome:**
The project resulted in a series of fully customized, 3D-printed prosthetic covers, blending form, function, and personal aesthetics. These covers provide a new dimension of self-expression and comfort, transforming prosthetics into artistic, empowering accessories.
Moving forward, we aim to expand this initiative, refining materials and fabrication methods to make custom prosthetic covers widely accessible.
