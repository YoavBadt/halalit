**Clients:** Haim and Noga Shomrat

**Design process:** Haim and Noga Shomrat, an experienced bicycle touring couple and team, approached us with a request to design a solar charging trailer for electric bicycle long distance touring. Per their request, we designed the system as an add-on to the popular and loved Bob trailer. The system had to be lightweight and strong to allow easy towing while supporting the solar panels during long trips.

We explored several concepts until we reached a flexible, strong and light loaded structure, resembling a sailing yachts or a Calatrava bridge. On the electrical side we designed a simple to use and monitor system, based on an off-the-shelf MPPT solar to battery charger and a bluetooth charging monitor that sends live data to a mobile app mounted on the riders bike custom junction box with

**Outcome:** The system is now being used on a long journey in South East Asia by Haim and Noga and we are pleased to see the system is working well. We continue to provide long-distance technical support if needed.
